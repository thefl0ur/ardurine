## Ardu[ino][tange]rine üçä

Artificial sun (with quirks) or an overengineered way to turn a lamp on and off at a given time.


## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT ‚ö†Ô∏è

This project uses 220 volts. Be smart and follow safety rules. It's not production-grade and could be dangerous for you or those around you. Use it at your own risk.

It's not even guaranteed to work after all ‚Äì currently, there is no hardware available to validate it.

### How it works
Controlled via relay attached to Arduino, lamp goes on and off at speciefic time to simulate sunrise and sunset.

Every midnight, the `setupTodayAlarms` event fires, fills the `sunrise` and `sunset` variables with corresponding values, and attaches single-use alarms to turn the lamp on or off.

### How to generate sunrise_data.h

Sunrise data is powered by [SunriseSunset.io](https://sunrisesunset.io/)

1. In `fetch_data.py` modify `req_params` for adjust location
2. Call `python3 fetch_data.py` (`requests` package is needed)

### Software

* [RTClib](https://github.com/adafruit/RTClib)
* [TimeAlarms](https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/TimeAlarms)
* [Bounce2](https://github.com/thomasfredericks/Bounce2)

### Hardware

For wiring see source code.

* Ardunio (Uno)
* DS1307-based RTC
* HC-05 for blueooth
* Push button
* Relay module


### Communication

#### LED

There is a single LED that is normally off and lights up only if it fails to find the real-time clock.

#### Button

The button allows manually turning the lamp on and off but does not affect the alarms.

#### Serial

Both hardware and software serial operate at 9600 baud.

List of commands:
* `off` ‚Äì turns the lamp off
* `on` ‚Äì turns the lamp on
* `status` ‚Äì prints the current status of the lamp, mostly for debugging
* `time` ‚Äì prints the current time in `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS` format
* `alarms` ‚Äì prints two lines with the scheduled on and off alarm times
